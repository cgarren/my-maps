# Tool Calling Implementation

## Overview

**Both AI providers now have full tool calling support!** This ensures that all generated places are REAL, VERIFIED locations with accurate addresses.

**Current Implementation:**
- ‚úÖ **Apple Foundation Models**: Native tool calling via `Tool` protocol
- ‚úÖ **Google Gemini**: Full tool calling with multi-turn conversations (prioritized over structured output)

**Key Change:** We prioritized **tool calling over structured JSON output** for Gemini because:
- ‚úÖ Verified addresses are more important than strict schema enforcement
- ‚úÖ Prevents hallucinated addresses and non-existent places
- ‚úÖ All places are validated via MKLocalSearch before being returned
- ‚úÖ JSON parsing still works, just more flexible

## How It Works

### The Tool: `LocationSearchTool`

The tool uses Apple's **MKLocalSearch** API to find locations and extract verified address components:

```swift
LocationSearchTool.searchLocation(locationName: "Space Needle Seattle")
// Returns: SearchResult with verified address
```

**What it returns:**
- name: Official place name
- streetAddress: Complete street address
- city: City name
- state: State code
- postalCode: ZIP code
- country: Country name
- latitude/longitude: Coordinates

### Gemini Implementation (Full Tool Calling)

Gemini supports **native function calling** via its API. The implementation:

1. **Declares the tool** in the API request:
```json
{
  "tools": [{
    "functionDeclarations": [{
      "name": "search_location",
      "description": "Searches for a location...",
      "parameters": {...}
    }]
  }]
}
```

2. **Multi-turn conversation**:
   - Gemini decides when to call the tool
   - App executes the function
   - Returns result to Gemini
   - Gemini incorporates verified data into response

3. **Example flow**:
```
User: "Find coffee shops in Seattle"
  ‚Üì
Gemini: Calls search_location("Pike Place Starbucks Seattle")
  ‚Üì
Tool: Returns verified address
  ‚Üì
Gemini: Incorporates verified address into final JSON
```

### Apple FM Implementation (Native Tool Protocol)

Apple Foundation Models support native tool calling via the `Tool` protocol:

**1. Define the Tool:**
```swift
@available(iOS 18, macOS 15, *)
struct LocationSearchToolFM: Tool {
    let name = "search_location"
    let description = "Searches for a location by name and returns its verified address..."
    
    @Generable(description: "Arguments for searching a location")
    struct Arguments {
        @Guide(description: "The name of the location to search for...")
        let locationName: String
    }
    
    func call(arguments: Arguments) async throws -> String {
        let result = try await LocationSearchTool.searchLocation(locationName: arguments.locationName)
        // Return JSON string with result
        return jsonString
    }
}
```

**2. Add Tool to Session:**
```swift
let tool = LocationSearchToolFM()
let session = LanguageModelSession(instructions: instructions, tools: [tool])
```

**3. Model Automatically Calls Tool:**
The model decides when to invoke the tool based on context. Results are automatically incorporated into the generation process.

## When Does the Tool Get Called?

### Apple FM (Automatic) ‚úÖ
Apple Foundation Models automatically call the tool when:
- It's unsure about an address
- The user requests obscure or specific locations
- It wants to verify details

**User influence**: The prompt says the tool is **OPTIONAL** and should only be used when needed. This prevents overuse.

### Gemini (Required) ‚úÖ
Gemini **MUST** use the tool for verification. The system instructions enforce:
- **CRITICAL**: Use search_location to verify EVERY place before including it
- Do NOT make up addresses or guess
- Only return places verified using the tool
- Use EXACT address data from tool responses

The model will make multiple tool calls (one per place) and only return verified results.

## Implementation Details

### 1. LocationSearchTool.swift

**Core Function:**
```swift
static func searchLocation(locationName: String) async throws -> SearchResult
```

**Features:**
- Uses MKLocalSearch for accurate results
- Biased toward US locations (configurable)
- Returns structured SearchResult
- Comprehensive error handling
- Logging with üîß ‚úÖ ‚ùå emojis

### 2. LocationSearchToolFM.swift ‚úÖ NEW

**Apple Foundation Models Tool Implementation:**
```swift
@available(iOS 18, macOS 15, *)
struct LocationSearchToolFM: Tool {
    let name = "search_location"
    let description = "Searches for a location..."
    
    @Generable(description: "Arguments for searching a location")
    struct Arguments {
        @Guide(description: "The name of the location...")
        let locationName: String
    }
    
    func call(arguments: Arguments) async throws -> String {
        // Calls LocationSearchTool.searchLocation
        // Returns JSON string with result
    }
}
```

**Key Features:**
- Conforms to Foundation Models `Tool` protocol
- Uses `@Generable` for type-safe arguments
- Returns JSON string for model consumption
- Comprehensive logging
- Error handling with JSON error responses

### 3. Updated LLMPlaceGenerator.swift ‚úÖ

**Key Changes:**
- Creates `LocationSearchToolFM` instance
- Passes tool to `LanguageModelSession(instructions:tools:)`
- Updated system instructions to mention tool availability
- Model automatically decides when to use tool

**Session Creation:**
```swift
let tool = LocationSearchToolFM()
let session = LanguageModelSession(instructions: instructions, tools: [tool])
```

### 4. Updated GeminiPlaceGenerator.swift ‚úÖ

**Status:** Full tool calling implementation with mandatory verification

**Key Changes:**
- Removed structured JSON output (`response_mime_type: "application/json"`)
- Added `tools` array with `search_location` function declaration
- Implemented multi-turn conversation loop (up to 20 turns)
- Enforces tool usage via system instructions
- Parses JSON from text response (flexible extraction)

**System Instructions:**
```
CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. You MUST use the search_location tool to verify EVERY place
2. Do NOT make up addresses or guess
3. Call search_location with place name and city/region
4. Use EXACT address data returned by the tool
5. Only include places where tool successfully returned an address
```

**Multi-Turn Flow:**
1. User prompt sent
2. Gemini decides to call search_location for each place
3. App executes tool calls via MKLocalSearch
4. Results returned to Gemini
5. Gemini incorporates verified data
6. Final JSON array output with verified places only

**Logging:**
- `üîÑ` Turn counter
- `üîß` Function called
- `‚úÖ` Location found
- `‚ùå` Search failed
- `üìù` Final response received

## Benefits

### 1. **Improved Accuracy**
- Real addresses from Apple Maps
- No hallucinated street numbers
- Correct ZIP codes and formatting

### 2. **Verifiable Results**
- All addresses come from MKLocalSearch
- Can be directly geocoded
- Less likely to fail validation

### 3. **Flexibility**
- Tool is optional, not required
- AI decides when to use it
- Doesn't slow down every request

### 4. **Transparency**
- Console logs show when tool is called
- Easy to debug function calls
- Clear error messages

## Examples

### Example 1: Simple Request (No Tool Needed)

**Prompt**: "Famous landmarks in New York"

**Result**: Gemini provides addresses directly for Statue of Liberty, Empire State Building, etc. without needing the tool because these are well-known.

### Example 2: Specific Business (Tool Used)

**Prompt**: "Blue Bottle Coffee locations in San Francisco"

**Flow**:
1. Gemini calls: `search_location("Blue Bottle Coffee San Francisco")`
2. Tool returns: "315 Linden Street, San Francisco, CA 94102"
3. Gemini uses verified address in response

### Example 3: Obscure Location (Tool Used)

**Prompt**: "The best ramen shop in Austin"

**Flow**:
1. Gemini calls: `search_location("Ramen Tatsu-Ya Austin")`
2. Tool returns verified address
3. Gemini includes in final list

## Console Output

When tool calling is active, you'll see:

```
üîß Gemini called function: search_location with args: ["location_name": "Pike Place Market Seattle"]
‚úÖ Location found: Pike Place Market at 85 Pike Street, Seattle, WA 98101, United States
```

Or if search fails:
```
üîß Gemini called function: search_location with args: ["location_name": "Nonexistent Place"]
‚ùå Location search failed: No results
```

## Configuration

### Gemini Tool Declaration

Located in `LocationSearchTool.geminiFunctionDeclaration`:

```swift
"description": "Searches for a location by name and returns its verified address. 
                Use this when you need to verify an address or when you're not 
                confident about the exact address details..."
```

**Key parts**:
- Clear description of when to use
- Parameter documentation
- Search tips (include city/region)

### Prompt Instructions

Both models are told:
- Tool is **available** but **optional**
- Use only when needed for verification
- Be confident with well-known places
- Don't overuse the tool

## Performance Considerations

### API Calls
- Each tool call = 1 additional API request
- Multi-turn conversations increase latency
- Max 10 turns prevents runaway costs

### Rate Limiting
- MKLocalSearch has rate limits
- Gemini API has rate limits
- Tool usage is naturally limited by AI's discretion

### Optimization Tips
1. **Encourage confidence**: Prompt tells AI to be confident
2. **Limit turns**: Max 10 conversation turns
3. **Cache results**: Future enhancement
4. **Batch requests**: Future enhancement

## Error Handling

### Tool Errors
```swift
catch {
    // Return error to model
    let errorResponse: [String: Any] = [
        "functionResponse": [
            "name": functionName,
            "response": ["error": error.localizedDescription]
        ]
    ]
}
```

Gemini receives the error and can:
- Try a different search term
- Provide a best-guess address
- Skip that location

### API Errors
- Network failures: Handled with timeouts
- Invalid responses: Throws clear errors
- Max turns exceeded: Prevents infinite loops

## Future Enhancements

### 1. **Batch Tool Calls**
Allow Gemini to call the tool multiple times in parallel:
```json
{
  "functionCalls": [
    {"name": "search_location", "args": {"location_name": "Place 1"}},
    {"name": "search_location", "args": {"location_name": "Place 2"}}
  ]
}
```

### 2. **Apple FM Native Tool Support**
When Apple adds tool calling to Foundation Models:
```swift
let tools = [LocationSearchTool.asFMTool()]
let session = LanguageModelSession(instructions: instructions, tools: tools)
```

### 3. **Additional Tools**
- `get_hours`: Get business hours
- `get_rating`: Get ratings/reviews
- `verify_address`: Validate without searching

### 4. **Caching**
Cache tool results to reduce API calls:
```swift
private static var searchCache: [String: SearchResult] = [:]
```

### 5. **Better Error Recovery**
- Automatic retries with modified queries
- Fallback to fuzzy search
- Alternative data sources

## Testing

### Test Tool Calling

1. **Enable verbose logging** (already done)
2. **Use prompts that trigger tool use**:
   - "Specific coffee shop in Seattle"
   - "The Space Needle"
   - "Pike Place Market"

3. **Watch console output**:
   - Look for üîß (function called)
   - Look for ‚úÖ (result returned)
   - Check final JSON has accurate addresses

4. **Test error handling**:
   - Invalid location names
   - Network failures
   - Rate limit scenarios

### Example Test Prompts

**Should use tool**:
- "Find the address for Tartine Bakery in San Francisco"
- "Top rated pizza place in Brooklyn"

**Might not use tool** (well-known):
- "Statue of Liberty"
- "Golden Gate Bridge"
- "Central Park New York"

## Troubleshooting

### Tool Not Being Called

**Possible causes**:
1. Gemini is confident (normal)
2. Tools not properly declared
3. API version doesn't support tools

**Solution**: Check console for üîß emoji, verify tools in request body

### Too Many Tool Calls

**Possible causes**:
1. Prompt too encouraging
2. Model being too cautious

**Solution**: Update system instructions to emphasize optional nature

### Search Failures

**Possible causes**:
1. Vague location names
2. Location doesn't exist
3. MKLocalSearch rate limits

**Solution**: Include city/region in search, handle errors gracefully

## Conclusion

Tool calling significantly improves address accuracy by allowing AI models to verify information with real data sources. Gemini supports this natively with multi-turn conversations, while Apple Foundation Models can benefit from future native tool support.

The implementation is production-ready with:
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive error handling
- ‚úÖ Rate limit protection (max turns)
- ‚úÖ Detailed logging
- ‚úÖ Flexible, optional usage
- ‚úÖ Real, verifiable addresses

---

**Status:** ‚úÖ Tool Calling Fully Implemented for Both Providers  
**Apple FM Support:** Native tool calling via `Tool` protocol  
**Gemini Support:** Full tool calling with mandatory verification  
**Tool:** MKLocalSearch via `LocationSearchTool` and `LocationSearchToolFM`

## Design Decision: Tool Calling > Structured Output

**Gemini API Limitation:**
```
"Function calling with a response mime type: 'application/json' is unsupported"
```

You cannot use both:
- `tools` (function calling)
- `generationConfig.response_mime_type = "application/json"` (structured output)

**Our Choice:** **Prioritized tool calling** because:
1. ‚úÖ **Accuracy is critical** - verified addresses prevent user frustration
2. ‚úÖ **No hallucinations** - all places are real and findable
3. ‚úÖ **JSON parsing still works** - we extract JSON from text response
4. ‚úÖ **Better UX** - users get places they can actually visit
5. ‚ùå Strict schema enforcement is nice-to-have, not essential

**Result:** Gemini now verifies EVERY place before returning it, dramatically improving accuracy
