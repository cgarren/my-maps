# Apple Foundation Models Tool Calling Implementation ‚úÖ

## Overview

Successfully implemented **native tool calling** for Apple Foundation Models using the `Tool` protocol. The on-device AI can now automatically call the `search_location` tool to verify addresses and find real locations.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. New File: `LocationSearchToolFM.swift`

A proper `Tool` implementation that conforms to Apple's Foundation Models API:

```swift
@available(iOS 18, macOS 15, *)
struct LocationSearchToolFM: Tool {
    let name = "search_location"
    let description = "Searches for a location by name and returns its verified address..."
    
    @Generable(description: "Arguments for searching a location")
    struct Arguments {
        @Guide(description: "The name of the location to search for...")
        let locationName: String
    }
    
    func call(arguments: Arguments) async throws -> String {
        // Calls LocationSearchTool.searchLocation
        // Returns JSON string with verified address
    }
}
```

**Key Features:**
- ‚úÖ Conforms to `Tool` protocol
- ‚úÖ Uses `@Generable` for type-safe arguments
- ‚úÖ Uses `@Guide` for parameter descriptions
- ‚úÖ Returns JSON string for model consumption
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive logging with emojis
- ‚úÖ Error handling with JSON error responses

### 2. Updated: `LLMPlaceGenerator.swift`

Integrated the tool into the place generation flow:

**Before:**
```swift
let session = LanguageModelSession(instructions: instructions)
```

**After:**
```swift
let tool = LocationSearchToolFM()
let session = LanguageModelSession(instructions: instructions, tools: [tool])
```

**Updated System Instructions:**
- Informs model about tool availability
- Explains when to use the tool (optional, only when needed)
- Encourages confidence with well-known places
- Prevents tool overuse

### 3. Enhanced: `LocationSearchTool.swift`

Added comprehensive logging to track tool usage:

```swift
print("üîß [\(#function)] Tool called with input: \"\(trimmed)\"")
// ... search logic ...
print("‚úÖ [\(#function)] Found: \"\(result.name)\" at \(result.formattedAddress)")
// or
print("‚ùå [\(#function)] Search failed: \(error.localizedDescription)")
```

## How It Works

### 1. Model Receives Instructions
The model is told it has access to a `search_location` tool and when to use it.

### 2. Model Decides to Call Tool
During generation, if the model is unsure about an address, it can call the tool:
```
Tool Call: search_location(locationName: "Blue Bottle Coffee San Francisco")
```

### 3. Tool Executes
`LocationSearchToolFM.call()` is invoked:
- Logs the call with üîß
- Calls `LocationSearchTool.searchLocation()`
- Uses MKLocalSearch to find the location
- Returns JSON with verified address

### 4. Model Incorporates Result
The model receives the verified address and uses it in the final output.

### 5. Structured Output
The model still returns `[LLMTemplatePlace]` with verified addresses included.

## Example Flow

```
User: "Generate coffee shops in San Francisco"
  ‚Üì
Model: Generates list, unsure about "Blue Bottle Coffee" address
  ‚Üì
Model: Calls search_location("Blue Bottle Coffee San Francisco")
  ‚Üì
Tool: üîß [Apple FM Tool] search_location called with input: "Blue Bottle Coffee San Francisco"
  ‚Üì
Tool: Uses MKLocalSearch to find location
  ‚Üì
Tool: ‚úÖ [Apple FM Tool] Returning result: Blue Bottle Coffee at 315 Linden Street, San Francisco, CA, 94102, United States
  ‚Üì
Model: Incorporates verified address into LLMTemplatePlace
  ‚Üì
User: Receives accurate, verified addresses
```

## Benefits

### 1. **Improved Accuracy**
- Real addresses from Apple Maps
- No hallucinated street numbers
- Correct ZIP codes and formatting

### 2. **Privacy-Preserving**
- 100% on-device processing
- Tool calls happen locally
- No data sent to cloud

### 3. **Automatic & Smart**
- Model decides when to use tool
- Optional usage prevents overuse
- Seamless integration with structured output

### 4. **Type-Safe**
- `@Generable` ensures type safety
- Compile-time argument validation
- No runtime parsing errors

### 5. **Observable**
- Comprehensive logging
- Easy to debug
- Clear visual indicators (üîß ‚úÖ ‚ùå)

## Logging Output

When the tool is called, you'll see:

```
üîß [Apple FM Tool] search_location called with input: "Space Needle Seattle"
üîß [searchLocation(locationName:)] Tool called with input: "Space Needle Seattle"
‚úÖ [searchLocation(locationName:)] Found: "Space Needle" at 400 Broad Street, Seattle, WA, 98109, United States
‚úÖ [Apple FM Tool] Returning result: Space Needle at 400 Broad Street, Seattle, WA, 98109, United States
```

## Comparison: Apple FM vs Gemini

## Testing

### Test 1: Well-Known Place
```
Prompt: "Famous landmarks in New York"
Expected: Model provides addresses directly (no tool calls needed)
```

### Test 2: Specific Business
```
Prompt: "Blue Bottle Coffee locations in San Francisco"
Expected: Model may call tool to verify addresses
Console: üîß logs showing tool invocation
```

### Test 3: Obscure Location
```
Prompt: "Best ramen in Austin"
Expected: Model calls tool for verification
Console: Multiple üîß ‚úÖ logs
```

## Files Modified

2. Watch console logs to see tool calls in action
3. Compare accuracy with Gemini (no tool calling)

### For Developers
1. Monitor tool usage patterns
2. Adjust prompt to optimize tool calling frequency
3. Consider adding more tools (hours, ratings, etc.)

### Future Enhancements
